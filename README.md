# PathOfMelvor-Public
Public release for Path of Melvor, a mod for Melvor Idle. Check it out: https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/path-of-melvor

Tracked issues / ideas:
  - Investigate the feasibility of implementing a toggle system to switch between modded and vanilla saves.
    - This will likely be obsolete when mod profiles are added to the mod manager.
  - Refactor the existing save system to support more item variants and extra features.
    - Backup saves are planned.
  - Explore the idea of having drops appear as unidentified versions rather than pre-rolled versions to alleviate storage issues and reduce clutter in the drop information.
  - Resolve the issue where locked items from the mod become unlocked upon reloading the game.
  - Resolve the issue with the "CopyConditionalModifiers" functionality to make it work properly.
  - Assess compatibility between Path of Melvor and  other mods.
